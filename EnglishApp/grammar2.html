  <h2>Lesson 2: Verbs and Tenses</h2>

  <!-- Verbs Section -->
  <h3>1️⃣ Verbs</h3>
  <p>A <b>verb</b> is a word that describes an action, occurrence, or state of being. Verbs are essential for forming sentences.</p>
  
  <h4>Types of Verbs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Action Verbs:</b> show an action. <i>run, eat, write, play</i></li>
    <li><b>Linking Verbs:</b> connect the subject to a subject complement. <i>am, is, are, was, were, become</i></li>
    <li><b>Helping (Auxiliary) Verbs:</b> help the main verb to form tenses, questions, negatives. <i>is, are, have, has, do, did</i></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <b>Examples of Verbs:</b><br>
    1. She <i>runs</i> every morning. (Action Verb)<br>
    2. He <i>is</i> a good student. (Linking Verb)<br>
    3. They <i>have finished</i> their homework. (Helping Verb)
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    💡 Tip: Every sentence must have at least one verb.
  </div>

  <div class="common-mistake">
    ❌ Common Mistake: Leaving out verbs in sentences. <br>
    Example: “She very smart.” → ❌<br>
    ✅ Correct: “She <b>is</b> very smart.”
  </div>
